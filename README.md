# Sapient_Ecommerce_API
The following API is an clone for the Amazon or Flipkart website it contains all of the basic functionalities what these websites contain.But we have not created an website we just wanted to create an REST full service so anyone can use these functionalities to include them in their own website.

The code itself is production ready and fully documented so even by seeing code you can get an idea of what is actually happening 

We have written unit test cases for each controller functionality
